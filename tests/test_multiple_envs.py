# TODO(parallel-hang): Add unit tests for parallel execution of multiple environments.

# Test that you can load multiple scenes, save 3rd scene, clear, load the saved 3rd scene as the first and only scene,
# and make sure that the position is correct

# Test that you can load multiple scenes, and all the global poses are different by the same amount

# Test that you can load multiple scenes and turn on a particle source in all three and nothing breaks

# Load a scene with a robot and everything, then save the state, then move the scene prim far away, then load the state, and make sure nothing goes
# to the original position.
